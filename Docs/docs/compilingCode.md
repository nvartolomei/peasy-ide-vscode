## **Automatic Compilation**

Compiling P programs is now super easy with Peasy!

Peasy compiles a P project with `p compile` whenever one of its P files changes, whether you save it or it changes on disk, for example after a `git checkout`. Opening a file compiles its project too, unless nothing changed since the last compile. To compile the current project yourself, press ++ctrl++ + ++b++ or ++f5++.

Compilation runs in the background. The `P` item in the status bar spins while compiling, then shows a check mark or the number of errors. Hover over it to see the result for each project, or click it to see the full compiler output.

    </figure>

## **Error Reporting**

Peasy underlines compilation errors in the editor and lists them in the `Problems` panel. You can jump to the error location by simply clicking the error.

## **Compiling Multiple Projects**

Peasy compiles the P project that contains the file you save or are editing, along with every project that includes it through `<IncludeProject>`, so workspaces with several P projects need no setup. Each project keeps the errors of its last compile, so compiling one project leaves the errors of the others in place.

For files outside every project, press ++ctrl++ + ++l++ or ++f4++ to pick which P project to compile.

## **Configuring Automatic Compilation**

Workspaces with many P projects can take a while to compile. These settings control what compiles automatically:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `p-vscode.compile.onChange` | `true` | Compile when P files change on disk. |
| `p-vscode.compile.onOpen` | `true` | Compile the project of an opened file if it changed since its last compile. |
| `p-vscode.compile.includingProjects` | `true` | Also compile the projects that include a compiled project. |

To turn automatic compilation off, set `onChange` and `onOpen` to `false`; ++ctrl++ + ++b++ or ++f5++ still compile on demand.
